bayonet_charge;Bayonet Charge;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bayonet_charge_desc;The development of the bayonet in the late 17th century led to the bayonet charge becoming the main infantry tactic through the 19th century and into the 20th. As early as the 19th century, military scholars were already noting that most bayonet charges did not result in close combat. Instead, one side usually fled before actual bayonet fighting ensued. The act of fixing bayonets has been held to be primarily connected to morale, the making of a clear signal to friend and foe of a willingness to kill at close quarters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
portland_cement;Artificial Cements;;;;;;;;;;;;;
portland_cement_desc;The cements now in the market are of two kinds: natural, made directly from stone and artificial, commonly called Portland cement. The manufacture of the former consists simply in burning and grinding the cement stone. Artificial cement consists of about sixty-two per cent of lime mixed with silica and silicate of alumina in nearly the same proportions as those found in the cement stone, and it is free from magnesia. This seems to be the whole difference in its constitution. In use, the artificial cement sets rapidly and attains maximum hardness in a comparatively short time, the natural cement hardens rather slowly and reaches its maximum hardness only after a long period of exposure to the air. Artificial cement, however, allowed the widespread manufacturing of cement, not anchored to the availability of cement stone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
canning_process;Canning Process;;;;;;;;;;;;;
canning_process_desc;The canning process was invented after prolonged research by Nicolas Appert of France in 1809, in response to a call by his government for a means of preserving food for army and navy use. Appert’s method consisted of tightly sealing food inside a bottle or jar, heating it to a certain temperature, and maintaining the heat for a certain period, after which the container was kept sealed until use. In 1810 Peter Durand of England patented the use of tin-coated iron cans instead of bottles, and by 1820 he was supplying canned food to the Royal Navy in large quantities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
industrial_sawmills;Steam-Powered Sawmills;;;;;;;;;;;;;
industrial_sawmills_desc;By the time of the Industrial Revolution, the circular saw blade had been invented, and with the development of steam power  a much greater degree of mechanisation in sawmills is possible. Scrap lumber from the mill provides a source of fuel for firing the boiler. Efficiency is increased, but the capital cost of a new mill increased dramatically as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
industrial_furniture_production;Industrial Furniture Production;;;;;;;;;;;;;
industrial_furniture_production_desc; Where previously carpenters and joiners had made furniture along with every kind of building construction in wood, several circumstances combined to create a new profession: that of the cabinetmaker. The growth of cabinetmaking as a trade of its own eventually resulted in a considerable degree of standardization of methods of construction, particularly in the types of joints used and in the thicknesses of wood for the various parts. It also resulted in an increased division of labour: turners, carvers, chairmakers, upholsterers all worked in their respective roles to make and assemble furniture. In the new system of construction, plain, flat parts are dovetailed together and then veneered. It can be contrasted with the traditional framed method of rails and stiles put together with mortise and tenon joints, the panels fitting in grooves. A large store often retained its own workshops where special items were made to customers’ requirements, but for the greater part it became the practice to buy wholesale from furniture making firms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
industrial_luxury_furniture_production;Industrial Luxury Furniture Production;;;;;;;;;;;;;
industrial_luxury_furniture_production_desc;Marquetry is the centerpiece of the decorative use of the grain and colour of wood in surfaces unbroken by panelling for luxury furniture. To produce the desired effect, the ébéniste, or specialist in marquetry, either drew the pattern directly on the base wood or affixed a paper pattern onto the wood. The thin sheets were then cut out with a burin or, later, sometimes with a saw, the pattern assembled and glued onto the carcass. Marquetry patterns became more and more complex and, though often floral, they could also include geometric and narrative subjects. The range of materials used also became more varied, including not only rare tropical woods and metals such as silver, bronze, and brass but also a wide range of other materials of a semiprecious nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
industrial_paper_production;Continuous Paper-Making Machines;;;;;;;;;;;;;
industrial_paper_production_desc;Before the invention of continuous paper making, paper was made in individual sheets by stirring a container of pulp slurry and either pouring it into a fabric sieve called a sheet mould or dipping and lifting the sheet mould from the vat. While still on the fabric in the sheet mould, the wet paper was pressed to remove excess water. The sheet was then lifted off to be hung over a rope or wooden rod to air dry. The Fourdrinier machine, the first continuous one, changed all that. It uses a specially woven fabric mesh conveyor belt in the forming section, where a slurry of fibre is drained to create a continuous paper web, with paper left in a horizontal drainage area, referred to as the drainage table.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
commerce_raiders;Steam Frigates;;;;;;;;;;;;;
friedrich_engels_desc;As a young man Engels went to Manchester to help his father manage his cotton-factory. Engels was shocked by the poverty in the city and began writing an account that was published as Condition of the Working Classes in England (1844). Here Engels met Marx with whom he would write and try to organize the international worker organizations for the rest of his life. Engels lived in the shadows of Marx's intellectually, but economically he financed Marx so that he could write. Basically there wouldn't have been a Marx without an Engels and vice versa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
commerce_raiders_desc;This first generation of steam warships are "paddle warships" (in the categories of frigate, sloop, gunvessel or other). They use paddlewheels mounted on either side or in the center. Because of the space taken by the machinery and the paddle wheels, the traditional broadside placement of guns is impossible on paddle ships. Therefore the ships were generally equipped with only a few very heavy guns mounted on pivots and slides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
james_mill;James Mill;;;;;;;;;;;;;
james_mill_desc;James Mill was a radical thinker that worked in the shadows of the brilliant Jeremy Bentham. Together these two men can be described as the inventors of Utilitarianism, and much of its general applicability was explained in Mill's works, Elements of Political Economy (1821) and Analysis of the Phenomenon of the Human Mind (1829).;;;;;;;;;;;;;
post_napoleonic_army_doctrine;Post-Napoleonic Army Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
post_napoleonic_army_doctrine_desc;The French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars that followed revolutionized military strategy. The impact of this period was still to be felt in the American Civil War and the early phases of World War I. With the advent of cheap small arms and the rise of the drafted citizen soldier, armies grew rapidly in size to become massed formations. This necessitated dividing the army first into divisions and later into corps. Along with divisions came divisional artillery: light-weight, mobile cannons with great range and firepower. The rigid formations of pikemen and musketeers firing massed volleys gave way to light infantry fighting in skirmish lines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
neokantian_idealism;Neokantian Idealism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
neokantian_idealism_desc;Kant's transcendental idealism had meant that the world can only be understood through categories, or ideal concepts that are inherent in us, and empirically. This is sometimes called weak empiricism. The neokantian idealist, however, departed very far from Kant and more or less went back to a more classical idealism though interpreted in a Kantian language referring to categories in their analyses of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
proto_existentialism_desc;This was not a philosophical movement but disparate philosophers analysing and discussing concepts and conceptions which they considered flawed. Things as varied as the general notion about things as Intuition, Time, Intellect, and Being had to be reformulated not to create pseudo-problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
combat_medicine_desc;At this point the armies and navies of the world had acknowledged the need not only for a medical corps within their organizations, but also that the illnesses and wounds delivered in combat and frontline duty needed specialization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
social_conscience_desc;Social Conscience is motivation deriving logically from ethical or moral principles that govern a society as well as individuals thoughts and actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
i_analytic_philosophy_desc;This was originally a disparate movement of philosophers who wanted to free logics and the foundation of mathematics from elder defunct and inconsistent theses. It later developed into trying to bridge language and formal logics and thus create an objective realist ground for reality. This took a sidepath into logical positivism. However the objectivist position crashed as one of its early protegés Ludwig Wittgenstein took a 90 degree turn and tried to refute his own earlier position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
logical_positivism_desc;Logical positivists denied the soundness of metaphysics and traditional philosophy. They asserted that many philosophical problems are indeed meaningless, primarily concerned with the logical analysis of scientific knowledge. They failed to secure what they themselves considered to be the sound foundation of knowledge and today are most often considered a dead-end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
dogma_of_mass_action_desc;At certain point a line of thought that developed from general radicalism was the dogma of mass action, which meant that only by means of mass actions such as rallying and strikes could the consciousness level for the worker be raised adequately for him to understand what was most beneficial for himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bessemer_steel;Bessemer Process;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bessemer_steel_desc;Named after Sir Henry Bessemer of England, the process evolved from the contributions of many investigators before it could be used on a broad commercial basis. It was apparently conceived independently and almost concurrently by Bessemer and by William Kelly of the United States. As early as 1847, Kelly, a businessman-scientist of Pittsburgh, Pa., began experiments aimed at developing a revolutionary means of removing impurities from pig iron by an air blast. Kelly theorized that not only would the air, injected into the molten iron, supply oxygen to react with the impurities, converting them into oxides separable as slag, but that the heat evolved in these reactions would increase the temperature of the mass, keeping it from solidifying during the operation. After several failures, he succeeded in proving his theory and rapidly producing steel ingots.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
thomas_steel;Gilchrist–Thomas Process;;;;;;;;;;;;;
thomas_steel_desc;Many iron ores contain some phosphorous and so does the pig iron smelted from them. Blowing the oxygen contained in air through liquid pig iron in the Bessemer process obviously did not remove the phosphorous. It neither bubbled out as a component of a gas like the carbon in carbon monoxide (CO), nor did it it become part of slag or dross swimming on top. But you must catch the phosphorous in some slag in order to remove it. The question to consider is simple: Why was phosphorous not incorporated as some kind of oxide in the slag formed during the blowing? One Sidney Gilchrist Thomas, a civil servant with an interest in iron making and metallurgy, took the bit in his teeth and set out to solve the biggest problem of the iron and steel industry. He enlisted the help of his cousin Percy Carlyle Gilchrist, a chemist who worked for an iron making company. They worked hard but had no luck for several years. Eventually the iron mill Gilchrist worked for gave them some support and they started experiments with a small lab-type converter, trying all kinds of materials they selected on "theoretical" grounds. They finally succeeded, announcing the Gilchrist - Thomas process during a meeting of the Iron and Steel Institute in London, March 1878.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
martin_steel;Siemens–Martin Process;;;;;;;;;;;;;
martin_steel_desc;Sir Carl Wilhelm Siemens developed the Siemens regenerative furnace in the 1850s, and claimed in 1857 to be recovering enough heat to save 70–80% of the fuel. This furnace operates at a high temperature by using regenerative preheating of fuel and air for combustion. In regenerative preheating, the exhaust gases from the furnace are pumped into a chamber containing bricks, where heat is transferred from the gases to the bricks. The flow of the furnace is then reversed so that fuel and air pass through the chamber and are heated by the bricks. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, but Siemens did not initially use it for that. In 1865, the French engineer Pierre-Émile Martin took out a license from Siemens and first applied his regenerative furnace for making steel. The most appealing characteristic of the Siemens regenerative furnace is the rapid production of large quantities of basic steel, used for example to construct high-rise buildings. The usual size of furnaces is 50 to 100 tons, but for some special processes they may have a capacity of 250 or even 500 tons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

speedy_maneuvering_tactic_desc;This tactic involves using speed to manoeuvre one’s vessel into a firing position at an opportune time and trajectory to render the enemy’s guns inaccurate, or even incapable of targeting the approaching vessel. Due to the speeds associated with this tactic, it also led to the need to train officers in how to make a breaking manoeuvre at an optimal time to avoid collisions, and to bring one’s own guns to bear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

fish_trawlers;Fishing Trawlers;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fish_trawlers_desc;The modern fishing trawler was developed in the 19th century, at the English fishing port of Brixham. By the early 19th century, the fishermen at Brixham needed to expand their fishing area further than ever before due to the ongoing depletion of stocks that was occurring in the overfished waters of South Devon. The Brixham trawler that evolved there was of a sleek build and had a tall gaff rig, which gave the vessel sufficient speed to make long distance trips out to the fishing grounds in the ocean. They were also sufficiently robust to be able to tow large trawls in deep water. The great trawling fleet that built up at Brixham, earned the village the title of 'Mother of Deep-Sea Fisheries'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
metallurgy;Metallurgy and Mining;;;;;;;;;;;;;
pattinson_process;Pattinson's Process;;;;;;;;;;;;;
pattinson_process_desc;Pattinson's Process is a method for removing silver from lead. The process is dependent on the fact that lead which has least silver in it solidifies first on liquefaction. In practice several crystallisations were required and the silver content of the silver-rich melt could not be raised above 2%.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
parkes_process;Parkes Process;;;;;;;;;;;;;
parkes_process_desc;The Parkes process is a pyrometallurgical process for removing silver from lead during the production of bullion. The process takes advantage of two liquid-state properties of zinc. The first is that zinc is immiscible with lead, and the other is that silver is 3000 times more soluble in zinc than it is in lead. When zinc is added to liquid lead that contains silver as a contaminant, the silver preferentially migrates into the zinc. Because the zinc is immiscible in the lead it remains in a separate layer and is easily removed. The zinc-silver solution is then heated until the zinc vaporizes, leaving nearly pure silver. If gold is present in the liquid lead, it can also be removed and isolated by the same process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
square_set_timbering;Square-set Timbering;;;;;;;;;;;;;
square_set_timbering_desc;Square-set timbering is a system invented by a German named Philip Deidesheimer that uses heavy timber "cubes" as supports for underground mining tunnels and shafts, that enabled skilled miners to open three-dimensional cavities of any size. In large openings, the cubes can be filled with waste rock, creating a solid pillar of wood and rock from floor to roof ("back" in miner's terminology). The system, which was inspired by the structure of honeycombs, enabled mining of the large silver orebodies of the Comstock Lode, which were in very weak rock—in miner's terms, "heavy ground". Deidesheimer refused to patent the innovation, which was easily the most important mining innovation of 1860.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

dynamite;Dynamite;;;;;;;;;;;;;
dynamite_desc;Dynamite is an explosive made of nitroglycerin, sorbents (such as powdered shells or clay) and stabilizers. It was invented by the Swedish chemist and engineer Alfred Nobel in Geesthacht, and patented in 1867. It rapidly gained wide-scale use as a more powerful alternative to black powder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
electrolytic_refining;Electrolytic Refining;;;;;;;;;;;;;
electrolytic_refining_desc;Electrolysis, or electrolytic refining, is a technique used for extraction, as well as purification, of metals obtained by any refining method. In the electro-refining process, a block of impure metal becomes the anode, and a thin sheet of metal becomes the cathode. Both the cathode and anode are dipped in an electrolytic cell containing an aqueous solution of the metal salt. Upon the application of electric current of a suitable voltage, pure metal is deposited at the cathode by the dissolution of impure metal at the anode.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
deep_mining;Deep Coal Mining;;;;;;;;;;;;;
deep_mining_desc;Deep mining means the extraction of coal through underground mining methods, including gaining access to the coal deposits by means of vertical or inclined shafts, by drift mining from the coal outcrop, or by other means that do not involve the stripping away of overburden to expose the deposit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
percussion_drill;Pneumatic Drill;;;;;;;;;;;;;
percussion_drill_desc;In Europe since the late 1840s, the king of Sardinia, Carlo Alberto, had been contemplating the excavation of a 12-kilometer (7.5 mi) tunnel through Mount Fréjus to create a rail link between Italy and France, which would cross his realm. The need for a mechanical rock drill was obvious and this sparked research on pneumatic rock drills in Europe. A Frenchman, Cavé, designed, and in 1851 patented, a rock drill that used compressed air, but the air had to be admitted manually to the cylinder during each stroke, so it was not successful. In 1854, in England, Thomas Bartlett made and then patented (1855) a rock drill whose drill bit was connected directly to the piston of a steam engine. In 1855 Bartlett demonstrated his drill, powered by compressed air, to officials of the Mount Fréjus tunnel project.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
friction_hoist;Friction Hoist;;;;;;;;;;;;;
friction_hoist_desc;Invented in 1877 by Frederick Koepe, friction (or Koepe) hoists are mounted on the ground above the mine shaft, or at the top of the headframe. They utilize tail ropes and counterweights and do not have the haulage rope fixed to the wheel, but instead passed around it. The tailropes and weights offset the need for the motor to overcome the weight of the conveyance and hoisting rope, thereby reducing the required horsepower of the hoisting motor by up to 30%, with the overall power consumption remaining the same. Friction hoists, unlike drum hoists, can and normally do use multiple ropes giving them a larger payload capacity, however since they require a larger safety factor, they are impractical for very deep shafts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lixiviation_mills;Lixiviation Milling;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lixiviation_mills_desc;Lixiviation milling, also known as Heap leaching, is an industrial mining process used to extract precious metals, copper, uranium, and other compounds from ore using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and re-separate them after their division from other earth materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

cyanide_milling_desc;The cyanide process (also known as the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
trinitrotoluene;Trinitrotoluene;;;;;;;;;;;;;
trinitrotoluene_desc;Trinitrotoluene, or TNT, was first prepared in 1863 by German chemist Julius Wilbrand and originally used as a yellow dye. Its potential as an explosive was not recognized for several years, mainly because it was so difficult to detonate and because it was less powerful than alternatives. Its explosive properties were first discovered by another German chemist, Carl Häussermann, in 1891. TNT is one of the most commonly used explosives for military, industrial, and mining applications.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
shrinkage_stoping;Shrinkage Stoping;;;;;;;;;;;;;
shrinkage_stoping_desc;Shrinkage stoping is a mining method used for steeply dipping, narrower ore bodies with self supporting walls and ore. It is an overhand mining method that relies on broken ore being left in the stope to be used as the “working floor” and to support the walls. During the mining cycle, only 30 – 35% of the ore blasted is extracted being equivalent to the swell factor of in-situ ore to broken. When mining is complete to the next upper horizon, the ore is extracted. Although it is not necessary to fill the resulting voids, they are commonly filled with waste rock from development. Level intervals seldom exceed 40 meters due to uneven muck draw. Recoverable pillars are left at each level.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
froth_flotation;Froth Flotation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
froth_flotation_desc;Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic. This is used in mineral processing, paper recycling and waste-water treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry, where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century. It has been described as "the single most important operation used for the recovery and upgrading of sulfide ores".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
hydraulic_excavator;Hydraulic Excavators;;;;;;;;;;;;;
hydraulic_excavator_desc;The very first excavator to use hydraulic technology was built in 1882 by Sir W. G. Armstrong & Company in England, where it was used in construction of the Hull docks. Unlike later excavators that use hydraulic fluid, water was used to operate the hydraulic functions. Also, it was not a true hydraulic machine, but a hybrid that used cables to operate the bucket but with a hydraulic cylinder operating a set of multiplying sheaves. The idea was not successful, neither on this machine nor on a machine of somewhat similar design built by the unrelated Frank F. Armstrong for Penn Iron Mining Company in the United States in 1914.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
entralized_economic_planning;Centralized Economic Planning;;;;;;;;;;;;;
centralized_economic_planning_desc;As more radical ideological alternatives to liberal democracy gained power in the early twentieth century, the opportunity to reconstruct economic organization based on State direction of economic activity that could be compared to the relative success or failure of traditional market-based economic structures arose. Such programs of centralized economic planning, employed by both communist and fascist regimes, often achieved dramatic initial results in reducing unemployment, increasing output of industrial goods, and removing the problem of conflict between laborer and employer in society, which the regimes would trumpet as proof of the superiority of their systems over free market systems. The social and economic costs to these societies, however, were often very high, and the resistance to State control created the potential for brutal repression. However, to the outside world that knew little of the negative consequences of these plans, they seemed to suggest a viable alternative to the free-market systems that had been the hallmark of nineteenth century economic theory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bolt_action_rifle_armament;Bolt-action Rifle Armament;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bolt_action_rifle_armament_desc;Bolt action is a type of firearm action in which the weapon's bolt is operated manually by the opening and closing of the breech (barrel) with a small handle. The first bolt-action rifle was produced in 1824 by Johann Nikolaus von Dreyse, following work on breechloading rifles. European armies continued to develop bolt-action rifles through the latter half of the Nineteenth Century and World War I marked the height of the bolt-action rifle's use, with all of the nations in that war fielding troops armed with various bolt-action designs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
existentialism;Existentialism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
existentialism_desc;Existentialism has many mothers. In one way it could be interpreted as a radical individualism traced from Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, but it is more. It is also the notion of the given as not really given but only meaningful through the process of interpretation, something that it got from Husserl, and more indirectly from Bretano. However it was taken further by Heidegger and later Sartre, Beauvoir, and Camus, and became focused on what gives meaning to the person, where the person should be understood as a being that is free to take action and thus create their own meaning rather than the more inflexible, outdated cartesian ideal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
polyphase_system;Polyphase System;;;;;;;;;;;;;
polyphase_system_desc;The polyphase system is a way to help transmit alternating current efficiently. In it two or more phases travel simultaneously. In industrial applications three waves is the standard, although at first two phases were used. The invention of the polyphase system by Nikola Tesla meant the final loss for Thomas Alva Edison and his direct current.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

rotary_kiln_desc;The Rotary "endless" kiln gives perfect control over combustion and produces a better grade of cement. The kiln is a cylindrical vessel, inclined slightly to the horizontal, which is rotated slowly about its axis. The material to be processed is fed into the upper end of the cylinder. As the kiln rotates, material gradually moves down towards the lower end, and may undergo a certain amount of stirring and mixing. Hot gases pass along the kiln, sometimes in the same direction as the process material, but usually in the opposite direction. The hot gases may be generated in an external furnace, or may be generated by a flame inside the kiln.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The main advantage of dobby looms is that more intricate designs can be produced. Dobby looms can be operated by wooden lags with pegs, which rotate around a roller above the loom. The pegs in the lags correspond to the lifting plan, which controls which harnesses are lifted. Punched paper pattern cards can also be used.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

cotton_gin_desc;The Cotton Gin is a machine for cleaning cotton of its seeds. The device pulls the cotton through a set of wire teeth mounted on a revolving cylinder, the fibre passing through narrow slots in an iron breastwork too small to permit passage of the seed. The simplicity of the invention — which could be powered by man, animal, or water — caused it to be widely copied despite patents. The cotton gin increased productivity of removing seed from cotton by a factor of 50. While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds, a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

lancashire_loom_desc; The Lancashire Loom is an self-acting loom, though it has to be stopped to recharge empty shuttles. The principal advantage of the Lancashire loom was that it was semi-automatic, when a warp thread broke the weaver was notified. When the shuttle ran out of thread, the machine stopped. An operative thus could work 4 or more looms whereas previously they could only work a single loom. Indeed the term A Four Loom Weaver was used to describe the operatives. Labour cost was quartered. In some mills an operative would operate 6 or even 8 looms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

steam_powered_silk_reels_desc;Silk reeling is the process by which a number of cocoon baves are reeled together to produce a single thread. This is achieved by unwinding filaments collectively from a group of cooked cocoons at one end in a warm water bath and winding the resultant thread onto a fast moving reel. By mechanizing the process, we could increase our silk-reeling efficiency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
