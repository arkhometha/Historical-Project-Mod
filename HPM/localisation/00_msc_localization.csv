claim_artois_desc;The comte d'Artois has traditionally been part of the Low Countries. Only during the era of foreign rule by Habsburg scum was it snatched by the King of France. As such, it is our duty to reclaim those lands back into our glorious realm, put their people to work and profit from their land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

build_neuschwanstein_title;The Neuschwanstein Castle;;;;;;;;;;;;;
build_neuschwanstein_desc;The Neuschwanstein Castle is a nineteenth-century Romanesque Revival palace on a rugged hill above the village of Hohenschwangau. The palace was commissioned paid out of his personal fortune by Ludwig II of Bavaria, "The Swan King", as a retreat and as a homage to Richard Wagner. The palace was intended as a personal refuge for the reclusive sovereign: it is said that from his bedroom in Hohenschwangau, Ludwig trained a telescope on a ridge to keep an eye on Neuschwanstein as it was being constructed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME110082;Smuggle Tea to $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC110082;After a failed attempt to cultivate tea in $COUNTRY$ in 1882 with seeds from India, Prince Mohammad Mirza known as "Kashef Al Saltaneh" who was born in Lahijan, imported Indian tea and started its cultivation in Lahijan. Kashef, who was the first mayor of Tehran and an Iranian ambassador to India under British rule, knew that the British would not allow him to learn about the secrets of tea production, as it was it is their biggest business in India. So being fluent in French, the prince pretended to be a French laborer and started to work in the tea plantations and factories to learn how to produce tea. Ultimately his plan was to take back some samples of this tea to $COUNTRY$ to cultivate. He was successful in this endeavor only because of his diplomatic immunity which stopped the British from searching his secretly stashed sample. At the time, Kashef brought 3000 saplings into his country from the Northern part of India, Kangra and he started the cultivation in the region Gilan, south of the Caspian Sea. The climate there was well suited for tea cultivation, and the tea industry quickly expanded in Gilan and Mazanderan region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME110083;A Trip To Europe;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC110083;Numerous suzerains of so-called "uncivilized" nations have made the decision to travel to Europe in order to support westernization policies. From Nasser al-Din Shah Qajar of Persia to Chulalongkorn of Siam and the many princes of India, the experience proved successful in enlightening rulers throughout the world. While this could help our country enter modernity, it will surely anger our more traditional elites...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT110083OPTA;We could learn a lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT110083OPTB;A king's place is in his country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME110084;The Treaty of Erzurum of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC110084;Tensions have risen again between the Ottoman Empire and Qajar Persia after order has been restored in the Kurdish areas. Border conflicts are now a common occurrence, driving up jingoist sentiment in both courts. Wishing to protect their interests in the region, the United Kingdom and Russia have intervened to find a diplomatic solution to the issues that plagued the area. The proposed treaty includes nine articles treating various issues, from territorial compromises to the status of pilgrims, forever establishing the western concepts of nation and borders in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT110084OPTA;This seems fair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT110084OPTB;We will resolve the issue our own way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME110085;A Rise To Power;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC110085;Amir Kabir has gained more and more power in our country. He now cumulates the positions of Chief Minister and Chief of the Army: this situation could be dangerous especially while the Shah remains young. His popularity is still low, both in court and abroad many despise him. Some whisper in our ear that it could be our only opportunity to stop him before it's too late...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT110085OPTA;The Shah demands his head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT110085OPTB;His life is safe: exile him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT110085OPTC;He is our friend and advisor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME110086;Amir Kabir assassinated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC110086;In $YEAR$ Amir Kabir Mirza Taghi Khan Farahani was murdered while traveling to Kashan, an obviously political move. Some are pointing fingers at the disgruntled nobles, including the Queen Mother. Others are blaming foreign powers. With him, many believe, died the prospect of an independent Iran led by meritocracy rather than nepotism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT110086OPTA;We mourn his loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT110086OPTB;We shall find whoever is guilty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME110087;The Swan King;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC110087;Crown Prince Ludwig had just turned 18 when his father died after a three-day illness, and he ascended the Bavarian throne. Although he was not prepared for high office, his youth and brooding good looks made him popular in Bavaria and elsewhere. Rather than live with the frustrations of a modern constitution and a feisty parliament reining him in, he spent his years lost in Romantic literature and operas, most notably by summoning Wagner at his court or by funding the construction of the Neuschwanstein Castle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT110087OPTA;Long may he reign!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME110088;Landel de Moura;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC110088;Father Roberto Landel de Moura was ordained to the priesthood in 1886 in Rome, where he also studied the physical sciences. A famous local inventor, he got recognized by his broadcast of a human voice over 8km around Sao Paulo - a technological feet of note! He then secured multiple patents, both Brazilian and American, for Wireless Telephone and Wireless Telegraph. His subsequent requests to the Brazilian government for assistance in developing his invention were denied, and his efforts then languished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT110088OPTA;Support his effort!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT110088OPTB;Give him an official acknowledgment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT110088OPTC;Interesting I'm sure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME110089;The $CAPITAL$ Convention on the South Tirol Dispute;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC110089;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats arrived today in $CAPITAL$ for the biggest breakthrough in $COUNTRY_ADJ$-$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ relationship in decades: a convention on the future of South Tirol, a territory both governments claim. We have to set a position and negotiate aggressively lest talks break and raise the spectre of total war with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT110089OPTA;There can be no compromise. South Tirol is $COUNTRY_ADJ$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT110089OPTB;Propose that we split the state, and that the minorities have their rights respected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT110089OPTC;A population and province exchange is needed to settle this once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME110090;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$-$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Talks Break Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC110090;Our envoys returned from $FROMCOUNTRY$ after talks with $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats broke down. Their intransigent position on their claims and the rights of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ population in South Tirol meant that no compromise was possible - something that senior figures in $CAPITAL$ see as the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government inching closer to a state of total war with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT110090OPTA;They will pay for their stubbornness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME110091;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Proposal: Splitting South Tirol;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC110091;After a particularly intense and long round of talks, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government sent a proposal they are willing to accept: split South Tirol with Bozen going to the Germans and Trent to the Italians. Diplomats in $CAPITAL$ are unsure what to make of this - it would settle the South Tirol question for now, with $FROMCOUNTRY$ promising to abdicate their claims, but is that in the best interests of $COUNTRY$?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT110091OPTA;That is an acceptable compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT110091OPTB;That is not in the best interested of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME110092;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Proposal: Population Transfers;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC110092;After a particularly intense and long round of talks, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government sent a proposal they are willing to accept: split South Tirol with Bozen going to the Germans and Trent to the Italians. Furthermore, they propose that the German population in Trent be paid reparations and sent to Bozen, and that the German population in Trent be sent to Bozen - with reparations paid for the displaced. Diplomats in $CAPITAL$ are unsure what to make of this - it would settle the South Tirol question once and for all, with $FROMCOUNTRY$ obliged abdicate their claims, but is that in the best interests of $COUNTRY$?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
