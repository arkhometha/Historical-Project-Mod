EVTNAME600050;Polish Insurrection;x
EVTDESC600050;When a Polish insurrection broke out in Galicia (Austrian Poland) and Krakow early in 1846 many Austrians held that Krakow's independent status provided the stimulus as well as a forum for the planning of Polish revolts.

Manuel Oribe, the former Blanco President, was forced to flee the country in exile to Buenos Aires. Rivera dissolved the parliament, called for an election and installed pro-Colorado politicians in the upper house while the Colorado Caudillos are laying down their arms and donating what they can to help the Colorado government. France and the United Kingdom, seeking the downfall of Rosas, are also sending help.;x

EVTNAME600058;Oribe's Exile;x
EVTDESC600058;President Manuel Oribe from Uruguay was deposed by the Colorado Party and fled the country to Buenos Aires. Governor of Buenos Aires and president of the Argentine Confederation, Juan Manuel de Rosas, received him as the constitutional president and soon offered him the command of the armies of the Argentine Confederation. Rivera, the interim president of Uruguay and leader of the Colorados, is extremely hostile to Rosas and to the Confederation thanks to the fact that Rosas and other Federalist Argentines backed Oribe in the past as well due to ideological differences. Rivera now harbour Argentine exiles that might cause problems in the future.;x

EVTOPT600058B;It's better to not risk a conflict.;x
EVTNAME600059;The Rise of the Colorados;x
EVTDESC600059;The political scene in Uruguay during the 1830s became split between two parties, the conservative Blancos ("Whites") and the liberal Colorados (literally "coloureds", more usually "Reds"). The Colorados were led by Fructuoso Rivera and represented the business interests of Montevideo. The Blancos were headed by Manuel Oribe, who looked after the agricultural interests of the countryside and promoted protectionism. The two groups took their names from the color of the armbands that they wore. Initially, the Colorados wore blue, but when it faded in the sun, they replaced it with red. \n \n The Uruguayan Constitution of 1830 didn't anticipate the sharing of political power between parties, which forced the minorities to resort to revolution.;x
EVTOPT600059A;Troublemakers, the lot of them.;x
EVTNAME600060;Oribe's Army;x

EVTNAME6000061;The Argentine Unitarianists;x
EVTDESC6000061;For a long time, two projects of country divided Argentina. Unitarianists or Unitarians were the proponents of the concept of a Unitary state (centralized government) in Buenos Aires and they were led by  Juan Lavalle. They were opposed to the Argentine Federalists, who wanted a federation of independent provinces, led by Juan Manuel de Rosas. The Unitarians, sympathetic to our government, fled Argentina in exile after being defeated in 1831. Rosas, the so called Restorer of the Laws, controlled the Argentina Confederation for too long under his despotic rule. They harbour Oribe, who claims is still president, and their government is hostile to ours. Our most trusted Caudillos argue that it is time to prepare for war and for that end we can weaken the Confederation by using our Unitarianist friends.;x

EVTNAME600066;The Italian Legion;x
EVTDESC600066;Giuseppe Garibaldi moved in with his wife and has been living in Montevideo for a time already. A sworn fighter against tyranny, he now has offered his help in setting up the defences of Montevideo against Oribe and Rosas and has offered to lead an Italian Legion made of foreign soldiers that will help us in the struggle against the tyranny of Rosas. Furthermore, it has been recommended that we do as the Blancos are planning to do and abolish slavery in Uruguay so we can have more soldiers for the war.;x
EVTOPT600066A;We welcome him and his soldiers.;x
EVTOPT600066B;We don't need any help.;x

EVTNAME600070;Brazilian Intervention;x
EVTDESC600070;The war with Argentina and the Blancos costed too much already and our people want peace, internally and externally. The Brazilians are showing some interest in the conflict, and our country, and they would help us much in the struggle against Rosas and Oribe. Our diplomats began the talks and the conditions the Brazilians are asking are the free navigation of the Uruguay river, taxes and trade benefits, renouncement of our claims on the border with Rio Grande do Sul and the recognition of Brazil's right to interfere with our internal affairs. \n \n Getting Brazilian help would undoubtedly tip the war in our favour and it is better than to risk another Blanco government.;x
EVTOPT600070A;I'm sure there will be no problems. Ask for their help.;x
EVTOPT600070B;We can take care of this war by ourselves.;x
EVTNAME600071;Uruguay asks for our help;x
EVTDESC600071;For a long time, Uruguay has been plunged into turmoil. It fights the Blancos, which aren't too fond of us, and the Argentine, which aren't too fond of us either. But the war isn't going very well for them, and they are asking for our help. In exchange for our help, they  are proposing several benefits for our country, such as treaties for the free navigation of the Uruguay river, taxes and trade benefits, renouncement of their claims on the border with Rio Grande do Sul and the recognition of Brazil's right to interfere with Uruguay internal affairs. This would undoubtedly bring our countries close together and can serve as a the start of Brazilian hegemony in the south of the continent;x

EVTNAME600072;Spheres of Influence;x
EVTDESC600072;After years of struggle for power, both the Colorados and the Blancos were weary of the chaos. In $YEAR$, they came to an agreement to define spheres of influence: the Colorados would control Montevideo and the coastal region, the Blancos would rule the hinterland with its agricultural estates. In addition, the Blancos were paid a lump sum of money to compensate them for the loss of their stake in Montevideo.;x

EVTNAME700000;Death of Francia;x
EVTDESC700000;Paraguayan supreme dictator, José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, took several precautions against assassination. He would lock the Palace doors himself, unroll the cigars his sister made to ensure there was no poison, prepare his own yerba mate, and sleep with a pistol under his pillow. No one could come within six paces of him, or even bear a cane near him. Whenever he would go out riding, he had all bushes and trees along the route uprooted so that assassins could not hide. All shutters had to be closed, and pedestrians had to prostrate before him as he passed. Sensing his mortality, he destroyed all his papers and refused medical aid, even lashing out at a physician with his sabre. In this day, Francia breathed his last and passed away. Francia left the state treasury with at least twice as much money in it as when he took office, including 36,500 pesos of his unspent salary, the equivalent of several years' pay. His daughter later burnt all his furniture after his death.;x

A few months later, Congress changed his post from consul to president, and elected him to the new post for a 10-year term. The constitution not only legally sanctioned López' dictatorial powers, but included no guarantees of civil rights. Indeed, the word "liberty" was not even mentioned in the text.\nHis government now is directing energy towards developing the material resources and strengthening the military power of the country. One of his first actions was to strengthen Paraguay's grip on the Chaco region by building forts and founding villages.;x

In 1853, he refused to ratify a commercial and navigational treaty with the United States and began confiscating the property of American citizens residing in Paraguay. Because of a dispute with Britain, López closed Paraguayan waters to foreign warships. Today, Paraguayan soldiers fired upon an American ship engaged in a scientific survey of the Parana River, killing one American crew member.;x

In 1926 Vargas became minister of finance in the Cabinet of President Washington Luís Pereira de Sousa, a post he retained until his election as governor of Rio Grande do Sul in 1928. From his position as state governor, Vargas campaigned unsuccessfully as reform candidate for the presidency of Brazil in 1930. While appearing to accept defeat, Vargas in October of that year led the revolution, organized by his friends, that overthrew the oligarchical republic. For the next 15 years Vargas assumed largely dictatorial powers, ruling most of that time without a congress. He held sole power as provisional president from Nov. 3, 1930, until July 17, 1934, when he was elected president by the constituent assembly.;x

EVTNAME50009;The Rise of the Andinos;x
EVTDESC50009;The course of Venezuelan history changed markedly at the turn of the 20th century. In 1899 General Cipriano Castro, a caudillo from the Andean state of Táchira, descended on Caracas with his provincial army and seized the presidency. As a result, five successive military strongmen from Táchira, known as Andinos, controlled the nation for the next 59 years, except for an interlude in 194548. The longest rule being the one of General Juan Vicente Gómez. Gómez was an effective, if ruthless, dictator. By manipulating elections, abolishing all organized political activity, and monopolizing appointive powers, he established a completely subservient legislative and judicial structure.;x
